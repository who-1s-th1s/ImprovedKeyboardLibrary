An Improved Keyboard Library for Digispark USBs

When programming a Digispark USB, I found the programming naming schema was inconsistant. My solution was partially rewriting the library for better consistancy. 
If you would like to use it, you can use it as a direct replacement or reference it as "DigiKeyboardModified.h"
